Online game site for my learning :}
In this example, I coded an online games website.
I used HTML5, CSS3 and JS to code this project.
The site opens games clicked in a modal, I think it's really cool and I've never seen game sites opening games like that.
In this version, open games continue to work after closing the modal, something that will be fixed in future versions.
